# 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array

# There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

# Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly left rotated at an unknown index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be left rotated by 3 indices and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].

# Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.

# You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
# Output: 4
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
# Output: -1
# Example 3:

# Input: nums = [1], target = 0
# Output: -1
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= nums.length <= 5000
# -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
# All values of nums are unique.
# nums is an ascending array that is possibly rotated.
# -104 <= target <= 104

After getting stuck for 2+ hours i have to check basic idea on chatgpt that, what is an approach 
to solve this problem. Basicaly i hate myself, i just can't solve a medium level problem.
And obviously it runs in 0ms.

Here concept is always check, if left side is sorted or not
if yes then check if target lies there or not
if not move to right side.

similarly, if right side is sorted then whether target can lie in that range or not
take decision based on that.

Following was my approach which was completely wrong

            if target >= nums[left] and target < nums[mid]:
                right = mid - 1

            else:
                left = mid + 1

        return -1
