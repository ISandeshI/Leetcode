# Given the root of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center).

 

# Example 1:


# Input: root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3]
# Output: true
# Example 2:


# Input: root = [1,2,2,null,3,null,3]
# Output: false
 

# Constraints:

# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
# -100 <= Node.val <= 100
 

# Follow up: Could you solve it both recursively and iteratively?

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def isSymmetric(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        def backtrack(node1, node2):
            if not node1 and not node2:
                return True
            if not node1 or not node2:
                return False
            if node1.val != node2.val:
                return False
            
            return backtrack(node1.left, node2.right) and backtrack(node1.right, node2.left)


        return backtrack(root, root)
