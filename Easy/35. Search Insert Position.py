# Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

# You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
# Output: 2
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2
# Output: 1
# Example 3:

# Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 7
# Output: 4
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= nums.length <= 104
# -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
# nums contains distinct values sorted in ascending order.
# -104 <= target <= 104

class Solution:
    def searchInsert(self, nums: List[int], target: int):
        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
        mid = (left + right) // 2

        while left <= right:
            if nums[mid] == target:
                return mid
            
            if nums[mid] < target:
                left = mid + 1 
            else:
                right = mid - 1
            mid = (left + right) // 2

        return left
    
    """
    in last line i wrote    return left + 1
    it is wrong as left is already at the correct position where target can be inserted
    The increment already happened when you did:
        left = mid + 1
        So left is already shifted correctly.

    so just return left

    this is best solution with 0ms runtime
