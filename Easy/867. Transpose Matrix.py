# Hint
# Given a 2D integer array matrix, return the transpose of matrix.

# The transpose of a matrix is the matrix flipped over its main diagonal, switching the matrix's row and column indices.



 

# Example 1:

# Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
# Output: [[1,4,7],[2,5,8],[3,6,9]]
# Example 2:

# Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
# Output: [[1,4],[2,5],[3,6]]
 

# Constraints:

# m == matrix.length
# n == matrix[i].length
# 1 <= m, n <= 1000
# 1 <= m * n <= 105
# -109 <= matrix[i][j] <= 109

class Solution:
    def transpose(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        rows = len(matrix)
        columns = len(matrix[0])

        ans = [[] for _ in range(columns)]

        for j in range(columns):
            for i in range(rows):
                ans[j].append(matrix[i][j])

        return ans
    

"""
It was simple, runtime 0ms and in memory beating 76% + solutions.
I forgot how to create empty matrix (2D). In this case empty matrix with row length was not necessary.
So i filled it later.
