    def removeElement(self, nums: List[int], val: int):
        j = 0
        
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != val:
                nums[j] = nums[i]
                j += 1

        return j


this inner code is a pattern. when you are starting from begining.
you have to delete one value assign something from next.
here you will use some condition to check for deletion. if true then pop.
this make further elements to shift left.

now problem comes if same condition appears consectively twice + times.
next element is already shifted to left and you have already checked current index.
This is where answers starts getting wrong.

To avoid this above pattern make sure with opposite logic.
two pointers are made. will keep moving one by one like scanning array.
another one will only move if opposite condition is met.
if condition is not met then do swapping with element.

This above part is very important.

Now if actual condition is met then no swappnig happens and also another pointer stays there.

This method saves memory by not creating any extra variable.
But it makes unnecessary swaps as well.

        x, y = 0, 0

        for m in moves:
            match m:
                case "U":
                    y += 1
                case "D":
                    y -= 1
                case "L":
                    x -= 1
                case "R":
                    x += 1

        return x == 0 and y == 0

if you ever have to use if statements for many times, then use match and case statement like above.
it shall be used only when either of case is definitely going to occure.

in python coding we can use "\" this character if we want continue same line of coding onto next line,
but want to see it in the same screen insread of using left to right scrolling.
